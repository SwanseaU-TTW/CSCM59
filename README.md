This is the source repository for Swansea University's CSCM59: Relational and
Object-Oriented Databases module. 

Please note that the official copies of all lecture materials including slides,
coursework, labs, and due dates are what's on the University's canvas site. If
there are any differences then the canvas copy supercedes what's on here.
