## Between semesters

There's no master branch! That's becasue the branch signifies which semester
this corresponds to. Before making changes for the next semester, create a new
branch with the name of the current semester --- likely based on the previous 
semester's branch:

```
git checkout <current_semester>
git checkout -b <next_semester>
```

Then, change the default branch on github
